This is my personal experimental website inspired by command line prompts.\
This website works best in fullscreen on a desktop or widescreen on a phone.\
The source code for this website is [here](https://git.juliusherrmann.de/JuliusHerrmann/commandlinewebsite)\
I also have a "classic" website [here](https://juliusherrmann.de)\

<colorblue>Who am I?<clear>\
I am a university student, studying computer science at the University of Saarland in Germany.\
I have been coding since sixth grade and I am always up for a new coding challenge.\
Besides studying I also work at my university as a programmer for various tasks. Check out my projects!.\
Cybersecurity is also one of my interests which I combine with my computer science major.\
Other hobbies of mine are ultimate frisbee and parkour.\
But most importantly:
