This is a continuous-time stochastic simulation of epidemic spreading on human-to-human contact networks.\
I developed this at my university job.\
I coded the whole frontend. The actual code for the simulation is not by me as computer simulation is not my current major.\
It was a very good exercise in learning React.\
